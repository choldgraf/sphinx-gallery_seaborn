Seaborn-style gallery
=====================

This gallery demonstrates how to achieve a seaborn-like effect
for your gallery with a single CSS file.

For the CSS used to to generate this gallery, see
`this file in the repository <PATH TO CSS FILE>`_. You can use
this CSS in your own sphinx-gallery by adding it to your ``_static``
folder and configuring Sphinx to use it.
